To install DD4T, you need to do 2 things:

  * [Install the DD4T templates in Tridion](TemplateInstallation.md)
  * Create or modify your own web application

> Since DD4T supports both Java and .NET, there are separate instructions for the web application part:

  * [Setting up your .NET web application](DotNetInstallation.md)
  * [Setting up your java web application](JavaInstallation.md)
