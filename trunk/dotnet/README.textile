h2. Tridion MVC.NET

Tridion MVC.NET is a set of libraries to create an ASP.NET MVC3 powered
website. Although the content is retrieved from a Tridion broker source in
this project, the setup is flexible enough to use a different source. 

*Goals*
The goal of this project was to have a full .NET alternative to CWA,
which currently only runs on Java platforms.
