There used to be some extra files here to compile the project.

For legal reasons I'm not allowed to put these here anymore.

They are:
Tridion.Common.dll
Tridion.ContentDelivery.Configuration.dll
Tridion.ContentDelivery.dll
Tridion.ContentManager.Publishing.dll
Tridion.ContentManager.Templating.dll
Tridion.ContentManager.dll
MSVCP71.DLL
MSVCR71.DLL
netrtsn.dll
xmogrt.dll

You'll be able to find these in your Tridion installations
