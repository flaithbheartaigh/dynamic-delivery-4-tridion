#summary What is DD4T?
DD4T is short for Dynamic Delivery for Tridion. It is a thin layer of functionality on top of the Tridion APIs that exposes the Tridion object model to dynamic web applications. The goal of DD4T is to allow you to develop a Tridion-based web application directly, without having to code templates.

If you want to know more, see [Solution Architecture how DD4T is used to build an MVC web application].
