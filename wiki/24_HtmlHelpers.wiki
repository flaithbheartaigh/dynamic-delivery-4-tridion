A Razor view does not have a 'code behind' concept like aspx pages. Instead, you can use !HtmlHelpers. An !HtmlHelper is a simple helper class to perform tasks that would be too complicated to do inside the (limited) syntax of Razor. Out of the box, MVC comes with an !HtmlHelper with lots of useful functionality. .

It is possible to extend the existing HtmlHelper with your own logic. The DD4T framework contains some extensions, such as the !RenderComponentPresentations calls (see [http://code.google.com/p/dynamic-delivery-4-tridion/wiki/23_PageViews Page Views]). Within the SDL.Web project we have also created a number of extensions.
