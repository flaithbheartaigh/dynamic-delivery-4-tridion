A Razor view does not have a 'code behind' concept like aspx pages. Instead, you can use HtmlHelpers. An HtmlHelper is a simple helper class to perform tasks that would be too complicated to do inside the (limited) syntax of Razor. Out of the box, MVC comes with an HtmlHelper with lots of useful functionality. See&nbsp;ï»¿Developer documentationfor more info.
It is possible to extend the existing HtmlHelper with your own logic. The DD4T framework contains some extensions, such as the RenderComponentPresentations calls (see Page Views). Within the SDL.Web project we have also created a number of extensions.
