= Details =

  * The providers should ONLY contain code that interact with a source system such as Tridion.
  * The factories are responsible for deserialization and caching
  * Parameters of the factory methods should be simple types as much as possible. In some cases, the parameter is too complex for this. For example, QueryParameters are a complex structure needed to search for components. There is no way to pass in all that information using simple types.
