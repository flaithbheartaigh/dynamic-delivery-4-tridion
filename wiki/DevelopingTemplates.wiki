#summary How to develop templates using DD4T, Visual Studio and Tridion.

= Introduction =

To develop templates using DD4T, you need to perform some steps manually. This is done for two reasons:

  * We are not allowed to include Tridion DLLs and other artefacts in our open source repository
  * Addresses, user names, folders etc are unique to each Tridion implementation.



= Details =

  * Check out the DD4T trunk from SVN (https://dynamic-delivery-4-tridion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk)
  * Copy the following Tridion DLLs to the folder DD4T\dependencies\Tridion 2011 DLLs:
{{{
Tridion.Common.dll
Tridion.ContentManager.Common.dll
Tridion.ContentManager.dll
Tridion.ContentManager.Publishing.dll
Tridion.ContentManager.TemplateTypes.dll
Tridion.ContentManager.Templating.dll
Tridion.ContentManager.Templating.SiteEdit.dll
Tridion.Logging.dll
}}}
  * Copy the file TcmUploadAssembly.exe to the folder DD4T\dependencies\Tridion Tools
  * Create a config.xml using the TcmUploadAssembly.exe and place it in the same Tridion Tools folder (see Tridion documentation)
